# Javaranch College In Common Lisp

## # README

### Overview

This is my attempt at completing the assignments in the 
[JavaRanch Cattle Drive](http://www.javaranch.com/java-college.jsp) using
Common Lisp. This project will include my answers to the assignments.

Please note the following:

* As of 3/2013, I am still new to Common Lisp. My answers may therefore not be
  idiomatic or very efficient.
* This project is still a work-in-progress.
* I have no association with the JavaRanch web site.

If you see a better way of completing any of the assignments, please let me
know. I think this project could benefit from multiple solutions. Also, I would
love for this to become a useful introduction to Common Lisp programmers some
day.
